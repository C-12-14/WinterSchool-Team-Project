## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Instructions for Task 1:
Go to the `Task1` folder and run:

1) `part1.py` for Part 1
2) `part2.py` for Part 2
3) `part3.py` for Part 3 

You can also see the corresponding results of each part by checking the corresponding folder, named in the format `partXResults` 

Kindly note that in `par1Results`, only `TimeandDistance.txt` needs to be checked

### Instructions for Task 2:

Go to the `Task2` folder and run `task2.py`.

The video that we have made in Part 1 and are using for Part 2 is `video.mp4`

**Note:** We have not attempted Part 3 of the task due to the absence of an Arduino Board.



## Changes done by us

1. We used colors instead of grayscale for visualisation.
2. We faced a lot of difficulties when trying to use Template Matching for the 2nd Task. That is why we instead used a [trained model](https://github.com/rahulsonone1234/Traffic-Sign-Recognition) for detecting signs.
